# Initial experiments with Godot game engine

Current state: Just a procedurally generated sphere (the crappy longitude + latitude type), which is only visible when scene is run (not in editor)

Aims:
- [ ] Make sphere visible in editor when not running scene
- [ ] Add GUI that regenerates sphere with different attibutes
- [ ] Use Rust code in place of Godot code
